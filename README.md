===========
template being developed for personal website http://jenc.so

goal of project is to create flexible site generator:
1) content is stored in NoSQL DB (mongo here)
2) node server builds page from articles in DB
3) static page served up to client

this approach has been chosen to minimize weight and number of files sent to client

nice to haves:
1) content (anyone know a biographer for hire?)
2) figure out how to do this with media other than text
3) build the site builder (having everything generated thru mongo queries is cool, but manually editing the db is not)
